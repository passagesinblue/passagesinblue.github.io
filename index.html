<h1>Passages in Blue</h1>

<h2>A Public Diary</h2>


<div id="main">

<h3>30th of March, 2018</h3>
<p>
I'm in a little town near the west coast of Ireland.
</p>
<p>
I came down from Dublin yesterday by train.
</p>
<p>
Walking to the train station I had the idea that I would set up a website in order to improve my web development skills.
</p>
<p>
Then this afternoon after getting in from a visit to a supermarket, I thought that it might be interesting to people for them to read a public diary of my life, though that certainly sounds narcissistic now.
</p>
<p>
Nevertheless, here we are.
</p>
<p>
It will be anonymous but otherwise honest. Nothing too cringey but hopefully somewhat insightful.
</p>
<p>
My mother said to me yesterday that I could make a good counsellor because I seem detacted when she talks to me.
</p>
<p>
It's a career that would interest me but I dislike the thought of committing time to study and to work.
</p>
<p>
Writing I prefer.
</p>
<p>
I think I inherited a talent for writing through her side of the family.
</p>
<p>
Her sister could write well and my mother herself has been complimented by her peers for her letters and messages in cards.
</p>
<p>
I'll be here in the west for a few days. Easter weekend and beyond.
</p>
<p>
I'm bothered by inability to give this website a suitable name. I was thinking of 'A Passage In Time' but really that's just piggybacking on Dead Can Dance's eye for the poetic.
</p>
<p>
Passages In Time perhaps?
</p>
<p>
Still derivative and now leaning towards Al Stewart's Time Passages.
</p>
<p>
I have often struggled with names and piviotal words.
</p>
<p>
Looking back on this even it seems pretentious drivel. Oh well, perhaps it will improve. Unfortunate for you reader and me also.
</p>
<p>
I think writing or working on what one believes in most is the way to work well and often.
</p>
<p>
But I am probably wrong. It's an attachment, something that seems huge and profound but only because I hold it so close.
